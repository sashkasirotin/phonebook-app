# phonebook-app
phone-book api for home assignment
in this phonebook app i created a service for crud operation on contacts.

*things that i would like to implement if i had more time:
-more thorow error handling with error propogation
-fininsh unit tests,
- convert to golang
- add keyclock for rbak managment
- scale the api's and rate limit the reuqests 

atached relvant
-files postman collection to run the api's,postman env for token veraible,contact api swagger.yaml,zipped recording

main dev points:
- created a backend service .
- integration with postgres db.
- created contact table to preform the croud operation on;
- created useres table for saving user for authentication & authorization porpesus
- ran postgres on docker as i had problems runing it on my local.
- created a docker compose that contains the app and the postgress db.
- created postman collection to call the crud and user creation endpoints.
- created a swagger yaml describing the api for documentation.
- integrated open api swagger-ui for documentation purpesus






instructions of runing the flow 
- torun the docker compose go the project location and run from there: "docker compose up --build"
-after docker containers up and runing you can call just use localhost as host in path of the endpoint
-run create user password api add role as "USER_ROLE" can also skip and use user:alexander and password:siro1 (if any issues with user creation see below woraround)
-run create authentication with meantioned user and pass in body; and a token would be created;
- add token in next requests headers in the form of Bearer {{token}}
- can add contact api with authorization in header and body with all fileds-get response 200;
- run search contact by name full or partial-get response 200;
- run update get response 200;
- run search get response 200;
- run delete get response 200;
- run get contact by id get response 200 with contact details;
- run contactlist with pagination with a param for page int and size of values you want to see on the response get 200;


connecting to plsql in docker conainer bash:
psql -U postgres -d phonebook

creating tables in docker conatainer plsql:
CREATE TABLE users (
        id integer generated by default as identity,
        email varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        password varchar(255),
        roles varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    );



  CREATE TABLE contacts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    version INTEGER,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

***********************very important workaround**********************************
*******if for some reason user creation api stops working and there is no users in the table******
insert manuauslly :
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, roles)
VALUES ('bob', 'john.doe@example.com', '$2a$10$bqA.DPmQAgi.wfMurHsS1ebEyjD.kFYEr35nKijWz6eRKCoaPxi1m', 'USER_ROLE');

the password is encrypted ,after inserting to table and wanting to use authentication api
use user:bob and password:bob1
